# Calculator
I made a calculator built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.  The calculator can be used by downloading the repo and just opening the HTML locally in your browser.

## Why I made the site 
This site was part of a coding course called "Complete Intro to Web Development, V2". The course had students build a calculator that you styled yourself and wrote JS for to run a calculator. Unfortunately the calculator didn't fully work properly, even with the instructors solution! I went back and changed the .js file so the calculator would function a bit better. This was much harder than expected to get working correctly.
